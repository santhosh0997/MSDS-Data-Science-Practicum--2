## Setting Up the Environment

Make **"agro-climatic-forecasting"** as your current working directory.

```bash
cd agro-climatic-forecasting
```

To avoid package conflicts, create a **virtual environment**.

### macOS / Linux
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## Install Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---


## Run the Streamlit Dashboard

Once the environment is active and all dependencies are installed, you can launch the application.

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py

```
## Data Sets

You can find all the data files required for this project in the link provided below.
